Here are some popular sources for Verilog modules and IP cores:

OpenCores (https://opencores.org/): OpenCores is a repository of open-source cores/modules for various functionalities, including processors, memory controllers, peripheral interfaces, and digital signal processing blocks. You can download and integrate the available cores into your FPGA design.

Xilinx Vivado IP Catalog (https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/integration/esl-design.html): If you are using Xilinx FPGAs, Vivado provides an extensive IP Catalog that includes optimized and verified cores for various functions like memory interfaces, high-speed serial transceivers, DSP blocks, and arithmetic functions. Note that using some of these IP cores may require a license.

Intel Quartus Prime IP Catalog (https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/products/intellectual-property/ip.html): Similar to Xilinx, Intel provides an IP Catalog for their FPGA devices. The Intel Quartus Prime IP Catalog offers pre-built IP cores for various functions like memory interfaces, high-speed transceivers, DSP blocks, and arithmetic functions. Some of these cores may require a license as well.

GitHub (https://github.com/): GitHub is another great source for finding open-source Verilog or VHDL modules. You can search for specific functionalities or explore repositories from well-known organizations or users. Be sure to check the licensing terms and conditions before using the code in your project.
