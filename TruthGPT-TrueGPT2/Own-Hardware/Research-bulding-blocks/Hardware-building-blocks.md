# Building blocks on hardware design rationale

## Description

A database of hardware building blocks for rationale a spec design for looking an own AI chip.

## Literals

Logic 



## Stuctural Literals 

Recreate a DOJO design for runs predicatives gates of fpga injections.


## RISC Design 


## Boards design 



## HDL or own HDL AST lexemes


## Goal 

362TFLOPS

100 TFLOPS is 3000 GPUs in average potential outputs.

## Cost for implement the design

$30 MILLION = 40 dollars for CNCs implementations
