policy_with_temperature(q_values: &[f64], temperature: f64) -> usize
This function takes an array of Q-values and a temperature as input, and returns the index of the selected action. The Q-values represent the expected rewards for each action, and the temperature controls the degree of exploration versus exploitation in the policy. Higher temperatures result in more exploration, while lower temperatures result in more exploitation.

The function works by first computing the softmax of the Q-values with temperature scaling, which gives a probability distribution over the actions. It then generates a random number between 0 and 1, and selects the action whose cumulative probability is the first to exceed the random number.
