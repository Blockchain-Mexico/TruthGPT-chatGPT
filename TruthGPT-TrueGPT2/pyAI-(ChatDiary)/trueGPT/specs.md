Description

Data collection and preprocessing: Collect a large corpus of text data and preprocess it by tokenizing the text into words or subwords, converting the words to numerical representations (e.g., using one-hot encoding or word embeddings), and batching the data for training.

import os
import re

def load_data(data_dir):
data = []
for file in os.listdir(data_dir):
with open(os.path.join(data_dir, file), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
text = f.read()
# split text into sentences
sentences = re.split('[.!?]', text)
# remove any leading/trailing whitespace from each sentence
sentences = [s.strip() for s in sentences]
data.extend(sentences)
return data

def preprocess_data(sentences):
# perform any necessary text cleaning or feature extraction
processed_data = []
for sentence in sentences:
# for example, we can remove any special characters and lowercase the text
sentence = re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9]+', ' ', sentence).lower()
processed_data.append(sentence)
return processed_data

# example usage:
data_dir = 'path/to/data/directory'
sentences = load_data(data_dir)
processed_data = preprocess_data(sentences)


Preprocessing
Once we have collected the text data, we need to preprocess it in order to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Here are some common preprocessing steps:

Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to reduce the vocabulary size.
Stopword removal: Remove common words such as "the", "a", and "an" that don't carry much meaning.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form, e.g. "running" to "run".


import random

# Load the preprocessed data and vocabulary
with open('preprocessed_data.txt', 'r') as f:
data = [[int(i) for i in line.strip().split()] for line in f]

with open('vocabulary.txt', 'r') as f:
vocabulary = [line.strip() for line in f]

# Define some constants
seq_length = 20
num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32
learning_rate = 0.01

# Define the model architecture
class LanguageModel:
def __init__(self, vocabulary_size, embedding_size, hidden_size):
self.vocabulary_size = vocabulary_size
self.embedding_size = embedding_size
self.hidden_size = hidden_size

        self.embedding_layer = [[random.random() for _ in range(embedding_size)] for _ in range(vocabulary_size)]
        self.hidden_layer = [0 for _ in range(hidden_size)]
        self.output_layer = [0 for _ in range(vocabulary_size)]

    def forward(self, inputs):
        # Embed the input sequence
        embedded_inputs = [self.embedding_layer[i] for i in inputs]

        # Compute the hidden state
        for embedding in embedded_inputs:
            self.hidden

import requests

# Collect data from Twitter
twitter_data = []
response = requests.get('https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=sentiment%20analysis')
if response.status_code == 200:
data = response.json()
for tweet in data['statuses']:
twitter_data.append(tweet['text'])

# Collect data from news articles
news_data = []
response = requests.get('https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=business&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY')
if response.status_code == 200:
data = response.json()
for article in data['articles']:
news_data.append(article['title'])

# Save collected data to a file
with open('data.txt', 'w') as f:
for text in twitter_data + news_data:
f.write(text + '\n')

Prompt leak 

# Define a function to generate text
def generate_text(prompt):
# Use TrueGPT to generate text based on the prompt
generated_text = truegpt.generate(prompt)

    # Post-process the generated text, for example by removing any inappropriate language or sensitive information
    # ...
    
    # Return the generated text
    return generated_text

# Define a main function to run the program
def main():
# Collect and preprocess data
data_dir = "data"
data = collect_data(data_dir)
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)

    # Prompt the user for input and generate text based on the prompt
    while True:
        prompt = input("Enter a prompt or type 'exit' to quit: ")
        if prompt.lower() == "exit":
            break
        generated_text = generate_text(prompt)
        print(generated_text)

# Call the main function to start the program
main()


Data Collection:

Initialize an empty list to store the data
Loop through each data source and perform the following steps:
a. Connect to the data source
b. Query the data
c. Parse the data into a standardized format
d. Append the data to the list
Save the list of data to a file
Data Preprocessing:

Load the data from the file
Loop through each data point and perform the following steps:
a. Remove any unnecessary features or columns
b. Handle any missing data by imputing or removing
c. Transform the data as necessary (e.g., normalization, one-hot encoding)
d. Save the preprocessed data to a new file






RNN architecture: Define the architecture of the RNN, including the number and type of layers (e.g., LSTM, GRU), the number of hidden units, and the initialization of the weights.

Training loop: Implement a training loop that iteratively feeds batches of data to the RNN, computes the loss using a cross-entropy loss function, and updates the model parameters using backpropagation through time.

Sampling: Implement a sampling function that generates new text by feeding a prompt to the RNN and using the model's predictions to sample the next word in the sequence.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the language model using metrics such as perplexity or human evaluation.
