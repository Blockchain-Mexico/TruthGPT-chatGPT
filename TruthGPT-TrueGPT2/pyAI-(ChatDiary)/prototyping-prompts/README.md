# Prompts

you create the terminal-prompt that create the AST injection to the lexeme-tensor-PT-model that put in the hardware desing automate

{}---[AST - HARDWARE]---[]

The AST needs to figuerion out how to compute

the tokenizer-learnin-tensor-model

Then this modular propmt  is for create the data set (code) to auto code.

1 You create the code
2 Easily is auto code and you can see the changes of the code. (174 billion of parameter is the floor price)
