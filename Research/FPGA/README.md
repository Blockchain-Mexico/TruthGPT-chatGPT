FPGAs provide significant advantages in throughput, latency,
and energy efficiency for implementing low-latency, computeintensive applications when compared to general-purpose CPUs
and GPUs

Choose an HDL (VHDL or Verilog) to write your program.
Define the input and output ports to connect the FPGA with the microphone and display screen.
Create a module to process audio input from the microphone and perform feature extraction.
Design an AI algorithm for speech recognition, such as a neural network or hidden Markov model, and implement it in the FPGA.
Create a module to display the recognized text on the screen.
Implement a testbench to verify the correctness of your design.

silly method: (TROLL MODE)
Choose a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.
Define the inputs and outputs for the neural network, including the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.
Implement the sigmoid activation function in your chosen HDL.
Create a module that performs forward propagation, calculating the output of the neural network based on its current weights and biases.
Implement the backpropagation algorithm to adjust the weights and biases of the neural network during training.
Define a testbench to simulate and verify the functionality of your ANN design.
Once you have completed these steps, synthesize and implement your ANN design on an FPGA to observe its performance in solving a binary classification problem.
