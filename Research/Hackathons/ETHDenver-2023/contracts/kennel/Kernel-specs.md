The Ikernel is a ML protocol 

IMLProtocol to interact with a machine learning protocol, which provides a predict function that takes input data as an argument and returns a boolean value. The makeDecision function calls the predict function of the machine learning protocol with the input data and sets the result variable based on the prediction. The updateMLProtocol function allows the owner of the DecisionMaker contract to update the machine learning protocol address.
