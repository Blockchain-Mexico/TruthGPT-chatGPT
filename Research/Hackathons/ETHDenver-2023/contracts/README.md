AIDecisionMaker.sol (Kernel Contract):

Contains the core functionality of the AIDecisionMaker contract, including the makeDecision function, executeDecision function, and the event for decision making results.
Includes the onlyOwner modifier to restrict access to contract owner for certain functions, such as updating the AI address.
AIDecisionMakerProxy.sol (Proxy Contract):

Acts as a proxy for the kernel contract and provides additional functionality, such as upgradeability and pausing the contract.
Includes the upgrade function to upgrade the contract to a new version.
Includes the pause and unpause functions to temporarily stop or resume contract execution.
AIDecisionMakerFactory.sol (Factory Contract):

Creates new instances of the AIDecisionMaker contract by deploying the kernel contract and linking it to the proxy contract.
Includes a createNewInstance function that creates a new instance of the AIDecisionMaker contract with the provided AI address and returns the address of the proxy contract.
Maintains a list of deployed instances of the contract for reference.
AIDecisionMakerRegistry.sol (Registry Contract):

Keeps track of all instances of the AIDecisionMaker contract created by the factory contract.
Includes a function to retrieve a list of all deployed instances of the contract.
Provides a function to retrieve the AI address for a specific instance of the contract.
This modular design allows for the separation of concerns and enhances the flexibility, security, and upgradability of the AIDecisionMaker contract.


Connecting the AIDecisionMaker with OpenAI's Gym requires setting up a few additional components. Here are the steps you can follow:

Install the required packages:
java
Copy code
npm install @openai/gym-http-api web3
Import the necessary modules in your React component:
typescript
Copy code
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Web3 from 'web3';
import { HttpProvider } from 'web3-core';
import { Contract } from 'web3-eth-contract';
import { AIDecisionMakerABI } from './AIDecisionMakerABI';
import { GymClient } from '@openai/gym-http-api';
Instantiate the AIDecisionMaker contract:
typescript
Copy code
const web3ProviderUrl = "http://localhost:8545"; // Replace with your Ethereum provider URL
const web3Provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(web3ProviderUrl);
const web3 = new Web3(web3Provider);
const aiDecisionMakerAddress = "0x..."; // Replace with the deployed address of the AIDecisionMaker contract
const aiDecisionMakerContract = new web3.eth.Contract(AIDecisionMakerABI as any, aiDecisionMakerAddress) as unknown as Contract;
Instantiate the OpenAI Gym client:
typescript
Copy code
const gymUrl = "http://localhost:5000"; // Replace with your Gym server URL
const gymApiKey = "your-api-key"; // Replace with your OpenAI API key
const gym = new GymClient({ api_key: gymApiKey }, gymUrl);
Create a function to interact with the Gym environment:
typescript
Copy code
async function runEnvironment() {
// Start a new environment
const envId = await gym.create("CartPole-v0");
const env = gym.get(envId);

// Run the environment for a few steps
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
// Get the current state of the environment
const observation = await env.observation();

    // Make a decision using the AI model
    const decisionData = ... // Construct the input data for the decision
    const decision = await aiDecisionMakerContract.methods.makeDecision(decisionData).call();

    // Execute the decision if it is accepted
    if (decision) {
      await env.step(1);
    } else {
      await env.step(0);
    }
}

// Close the environment
await env.close();
}
Call the runEnvironment function in your React component:
typescript
Copy code
function App() {
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

async function handleRunEnvironment() {
setIsLoading(true);
await runEnvironment();
setIsLoading(false);
}

return (
<div>
<button onClick={handleRunEnvironment} disabled={isLoading}>Run Environment</button>
{isLoading && <p>Loading...</p>}
</div>
);
}
Note that this is just a basic example and may need to be adapted to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to replace the placeholder values with your own Ethereum provider URL, AIDecisionMaker contract address, Gym server URL, and OpenAI API key.
