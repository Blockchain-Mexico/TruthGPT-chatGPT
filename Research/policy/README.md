# Policy

A policy π represents the way in which the agent behaves based on its
observations of the environment. Specifically, the policy is a mapping from the each
state s ∈ S and action a ∈ A to the probability distribution π(a|s) for taking action
a in state s, where the distribution is:
π(a|s) = p(At = a|St = s), ∃t

A bad poliicy is q  and temperature values in reverse order (non - optimal)

The goal of reinforcement learning is to find the higher
expected return by optimizing the policy
