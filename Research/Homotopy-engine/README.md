# Introduction 

Homotopy engine research is a project for looking for benchmarks and theory vs practice real time implemnentations.

Abstract method

it provides a way to smoothly transform one function into another.

Silly Ing.

The homotopy function computes a linear interpolation between f(x) and g(x) using the parameter t. When t = 0, homotopy(x, t) is equal to f(x), and when t = 1, it is equal to g(x).

Avoid interpolations computations: how? the lineriality glitch 
 a n plus complexity interpolations

to linear (n) -> quadratics

The linear is real case more than no linear methods ?
