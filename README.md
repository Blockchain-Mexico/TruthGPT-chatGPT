There are several guides for ML developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like Models and Transformers. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the GPT, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your GPT.
